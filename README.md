# Pandemic Game Tracker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/pandemic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelgwelch/pandemic)

This will be a tool to track your grame progress. Specifically it will
be useful for replaying Pandemic Legacy as permanent changes will be
saved to disk and allow you to setup the board as you left it without
using stickers.
