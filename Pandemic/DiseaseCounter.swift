/**
 A simple counter type that knows how to count to 3 but no higher. The counter
 may be incremented or decremented. If decremented the value can never go lower 
 than 0.
 
 - note: This class is meant to encapsulate the counting of disease cubes for a
 single color. Therefore, it can never go higher than 3. However, if the counter
 is incremented when `value` is already 3 then the counter will indicate an error
 state by setting `error` to true. This condition will stay in place until `clearError`
 is called.
 
 - warning: Currently no error is generated if `decrement` is called when the `value`
 is already 0. The counter will simply fail to take any action.
 
 - todo: Consider using a callback instead of using `error` flag to indicate the *outbreak*
 condition of `increment` being called when `value` is already 3. Then the caller would not
 need to check the state of the counter. Also the caller would not need to clear the error.
 Current implementation leaves something to be desired because if `clearError` is never called
 then the `error` flag no longer serves to indicate when a new error condition was encountered.
 
 - todo: Consider throwing an error if `decrement` is called when the `value` is already 0.
 In reality, this would most likely consitute an error in the program. The end user should not
 be allowed to use the *treat* action if there are no disease cubes to treat. If the game
 engine allowed it, that would indicate an error in the engine.
